**A high-performance, multi-user 3D research platform for observing and analyzing interactions between human participants and autonomous agents.**

This project is being developed as part of a seminar at the Technological University (Mandalay), Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project constructs a custom 3D rendering core to simulate a "Digital Vacuum"—a controlled, isolated space for high-fidelity interaction studies without real-world noise. It bridges high-performance graphics with Human-Centered AI (HAI) to study synergy between networking, persistent data, and behavioral modeling.

**Core Concept:** A multi-user environment where human-controlled avatars and AI-driven agents interact, with all behavioral data being tracked and saved for analysis.

## 🎯 Current Status & Vision

- **Current Phase:** Initial development of core systems.
- **Short-term Goal:** Implement a stable deferred shading pipeline and a basic client-server connection with MongoDB.
- **Long-term Vision:** A complete research framework for simulating unpredictable agent behaviors in strictly controlled, safe scenarios.

---

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- **Advanced 3D Graphics:** A custom OpenGL 3.3 Core engine utilizing a **Deferred Shading Pipeline**.
- **Persistent Multi-User System:** Login/sign-up system backed by a **Heartbeat Data Tracker** and **MongoDB**.
- **Intelligent Agents:** **A* Path-finding** and **Finite State Machines (FSM)** for agent behaviors.
